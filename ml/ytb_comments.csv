You’re great at explaining 🙌🏽 Thankyou so much for these videos :’)),1

"To clarify, the ""self.b1.clicked.connect(self.clicked)"" line is a bit misleading. Tim made a method called ""clicked"" referenced in self.clicked but the QPushButton also has a clicked attribute.
So, self.clicked references Tim's created method, while the .clicked attribute is built into self.b1. He probably should have renamed his method to avoid this confusion. Hope this helps someone.",0
